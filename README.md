Designing a database and code structure for the given assessment involves considering the relationships between entities, optimizing for search and sorting operations, and ensuring efficient data processing. Here's database schema and code structure design for the given requirements:

**Database Schema Design:**

1. **Movies Table:**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `title` (String)
   - `description` (Text)
   - `year` (Integer)
   - `director` (String)
   - `actors` (Array of Strings)
   - `filming_location` (String)
   - `country` (String)
   - `created_at` (Timestamp)
   - `updated_at` (Timestamp)

2. **Reviews Table:**
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `movie_id` (Foreign Key referencing Movies)
   - `user` (String)
   - `stars` (Integer)
   - `review` (Text)
   - `created_at` (Timestamp)
   - `updated_at` (Timestamp)

With this schema, each movie can have multiple reviews associated with it.

**Code Structure Design:**

Here's the code structure based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern used in Application:

1. **Models:**
   - Create `Movie` and `Review` models corresponding to the database tables. Associations between the models (e.g., `Movie has_many :reviews`).

2. **Controllers:**
   - Create a `MoviesController` handle index action related to movies.

3. **Views:**
   - Create views for listing movies (`index.html.erb`).

4. **Routes:**
   - Define routes in `config/routes.rb` to map URLs to controller actions.

5. **CSV Import:**
   - Implement a CSV import mechanism using Sidekiq to import data from CSV files into the database. Create a `CsvImportWorkerJob` that processes CSV data and populates the database tables.

6. **Search and Sorting:**
   - Implement search and sorting functionality in the `MoviesController` to filter and order movies based on user input.

7. **Pagination:**
   - Integrate pagination using the `will_paginate` gem to handle large datasets.

8. **Background Processing:**
   - Utilize Sidekiq for background processing to handle data import and other resource-intensive tasks.

9. **Database Indexing:**
   - Add proper indexes to fields used in search and sorting operations, such as `actors`, to enhance query performance.
